# Project: Spotify Top50 2020 Analysis

--------------------------------------------
## Project Objective

Objective for this project was to do an exploratory data analysis (EDA) with pandas python for a dataset with the top 50 streamed songs on Spotify in 2020. 

**Tools used:**
Python in jupyter notebook

## Project Content

**Spotify Top50 2020 EDA.ipynb** - jupyter notebook file containing python code and walk-through of the EDA

## Key insights

- Most popular artists in 2020 were Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa and Travis Scott
- Most popular album in 2020 was 'Future Nostalgia' by Dua Lipa
- Most streamed genres were Pop and Hip-Hop/Rap
- Certain correlations do exist between certain features of the top 50 songs:
    - The louder a song, the higher the energy level and positivity (valence) of the song
    - With higher positivity of a song also comes higher danceability
    - The more acoustic a song is, the less loud and less energetic it tends to be
    - Similarly, the more instrumental a song is, the less loud it tends to be
